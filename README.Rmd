# Haralson County Insurance and Poverty Dashboard

## Background

- This dashboard visualizes age-based comparisons of poverty levels and insurance coverage in Haralson County, Georgia, using U.S. Census data.
- It highlights gaps in public insurance coverage among elderly populations and elevated poverty rates among youth.
- Understanding these disparities helps local health systems prioritize interventions and funding needs.

## Objective

- Identify age-related patterns in poverty and insurance coverage in Haralson County.
- Support data-informed decisions for community resource allocation and potential FQHC proposals.

## Methods

- Age groups were harmonized across insurance types and poverty metrics.
- Flexdashboard with `plotly` was used to create interactive bar charts with hover tooltips.
- Toggleable categories were implemented using grouped bar plots.

## Importance of this Project

- By highlighting disparities across life stages, this dashboard supports health equity work in rural Georgia communities.
- These insights can inform grant proposals and health center performance goals tied to population-level outcomes.
